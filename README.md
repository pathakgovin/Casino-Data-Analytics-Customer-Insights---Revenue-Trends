## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, Prophet  
- **Machine Learning Techniques**: Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN), Classification (Random Forest), Time Series Forecasting (Prophet)  

---

## 📊 Dataset Details  
The dataset includes casino gaming data containing the following features:  
- **Month Ending** – Time period for casino revenue records.  
- **Total Wagers** – The total amount wagered by customers.  
- **Total Winnings** – The total winnings distributed to customers.  
- **Promotional Coupons Used** – Coupons and credits used by players.  
- **Net Revenue** – The total profit after winnings and promotional expenses.  

**Source**: The dataset is sourced from **casino gaming transactions**, containing anonymized records to analyze trends and patterns.

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
We conducted **in-depth data visualization** and analysis using **Matplotlib and Seaborn** to identify trends, correlations, and patterns:  
📌 **Revenue Trends** – Line chart visualizing fluctuations in casino revenue.  
📌 **Customer Segmentation** – Scatterplot illustrating high-value vs. low-value players.  
📌 **Correlation Heatmap** – Relationship analysis between gaming metrics.  
📌 **Promotion Effectiveness** – A/B testing analysis for marketing campaigns.
